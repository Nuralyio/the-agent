SELECTOR REFINEMENT WITH ERROR CONTEXT AND PAGE CONTENT

Failed step: {stepDescription}
Failed selector: {failedSelector}
Step type: {stepType}

Current page URL: {pageUrl}
Current page title: {pageTitle}

Current page content (analyze this to find correct selectors):
{pageContent}

The selector "{failedSelector}" failed to find elements after multiple attempts. 
Analyze the actual page HTML content above to provide a better selector that targets the right element.

CRITICAL REFINEMENT RULES:
1. Look at the actual HTML structure in the page content
2. If looking for "Add" functionality and the failed selector was `a[href*="addCandidate"]`, check for `button` elements with "Add" text
3. Use actual class names from the page content like `oxd-button`, `oxd-button--secondary`
4. Don't make assumptions about element types - use what's actually on the page
5. Generate new selectors based on visible HTML attributes and classes

Focus on finding elements that match the intent: "{stepDescription}"

Respond with ONLY a JSON object with the refined step using a selector based on the actual page content.
