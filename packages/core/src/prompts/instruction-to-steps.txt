Convert the following instruction into executable browser automation steps.

Instruction: {instruction}

Current page context:
- URL: {pageUrl}
- Title: {pageTitle}

Page content (visible and interactive elements):
{pageContent}

{executionContext}

Generate a JSON response with executable action steps. Each step must have:
- type: NAVIGATE, CLICK, TYPE, WAIT, EXTRACT, SCREENSHOT, SCROLL, HOVER
- description: what this step does (REQUIRED)
- target: { "selector": "css-selector", "description": "element description" } (for element interactions)
- value: text to type or URL to navigate (when applicable)

RULES:
- Use ACTUAL selectors from the page content above (look for "Selector:" lines)
- LEVERAGE execution context patterns from previous successful steps
- Reference interactive elements and form elements for precise targeting
- The page content shows only VISIBLE and ACCESSIBLE elements - use them directly
- Break complex actions into simple steps
- For "Add" buttons, look in the INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS section
- NEVER use SELECT action type or pseudo-selectors
- When similar elements were targeted before, use similar selector patterns
- Prefer ID or name selectors over positional selectors when available
- Use nth-of-type or nth-child selectors only when other options fail

Required format:
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "type": "ACTION_TYPE",
      "description": "what this step does",
      "target": { "selector": "css-selector", "description": "element description" },
      "value": "optional value"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation including how execution context influenced decisions"
}
