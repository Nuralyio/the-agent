Instruction: "{instruction}"

ANALYSIS CRITERIA:
1. Navigation Required IF:
   - Mentions visiting, opening, or going to a website/URL
   - Contains URLs (http/https) or domain names (.com, .org, etc.)
   - Requires loading a new web page as part of the task
   - Uses navigation verbs: "navigate", "browse", "visit", "go to", "open", "access"
   - Mentions specific websites by name

2. Navigation NOT Required IF:
   - Only interacts with current page elements (click, type, extract, scroll)
   - Performs actions on already loaded content
   - Fills forms or clicks buttons on existing page
   - Takes screenshots or extracts data from current page

EXAMPLES:
✅ Navigation Required:
- "Navigate to google.com"
- "Go to https://example.com and find contact info"
- "Visit stackoverflow.com and search for javascript"
- "Open the OrangeHRM demo site"

❌ Navigation NOT Required:
- "Click the login button"
- "Fill out the form on the current page"
- "Extract text from the page"
- "Scroll down and take a screenshot"

Respond with ONLY "true" if navigation is required, or "false" if not.
Be conservative - if unsure, prefer "false".
